# Systematic Debugging with Memory Integration

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

## Memory Integration (NEW)

This skill now integrates with the memory system to persist debugging knowledge across sessions.

### At Session Start (Phase 0)

**BEFORE starting Phase 1, hydrate context from memory:**

1. **Query Previous Debugging Sessions**
   ```
   MCP_DOCKER_query_database: {
     query: "SELECT * FROM events WHERE group_id = :group AND event_type LIKE 'debug:%' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10"
   }
   ```

2. **Search for Similar Issues**
   ```
   MCP_DOCKER_search_memories: {
     query: "debugging {component} {error_type}"
   }
   ```

3. **Check for Known Root Causes**
   ```
   MCP_DOCKER_find_memories_by_name: {
     names: ["Root Cause: {component}", "Bug Pattern: {pattern}"]
   }
   ```

4. **Present Context**
   > "Found N previous debugging sessions for similar issues. M known root causes identified. Key insights: [list]"

### During Investigation

**Log key findings at each phase:**

```
MCP_DOCKER_insert_data: {
  table_name: "events",
  columns: "group_id, event_type, agent_id, workflow_id, status, metadata",
  values: "'group', 'debug:phase1_complete', 'agent', 'debug-session', 'in_progress', '{\"phase\": 1, \"findings\": [...]}'"
}
```

### At Session End

**After completing Phase 4:**

1. **Log Root Cause** (if found)
   ```
   MCP_DOCKER_insert_data: {
     table_name: "events",
     columns: "group_id, event_type, agent_id, workflow_id, status, metadata",
     values: "'group', 'debug:root_cause_found', 'agent', 'debug-session', 'completed', '{\"root_cause\": \"...\", \"fix\": \"...\"}'"
   }
   ```

2. **Create Insight** (for significant findings)
   ```
   MCP_DOCKER_create_entities: {
     entities: [{
       name: "Root Cause: {brief description}",
       entityType: "RootCause",
       observations: ["Detailed description...", "Fix applied...", "Prevention..."]
     }]
   }
   ```

3. **Link to Events**
   ```
   MCP_DOCKER_create_relations: {
     relations: [{
       from: "Root Cause: {...}",
       to: "Event: {...}",
       relationType: "DERIVED_FROM"
     }]
   }
   ```

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue:
- Test failures
- Bugs in production
- Unexpected behavior
- Performance problems
- Build failures
- Integration issues

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

**Don't skip when:**
- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)
- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)
- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)

## The Five Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 0: Memory Hydration (NEW)

**ALWAYS run before Phase 1:**

1. **Check Memory System**
   - Query events table for previous debugging sessions
   - Search Neo4j for similar root causes
   - Look for patterns in past fixes

2. **Summarize Context**
   - "Found X previous attempts to debug this"
   - "Known root causes: [list]"
   - "Previous fixes that worked: [list]"

3. **Update Status**
   ```
   Log event: debug:session_start
   Status: in_progress
   Metadata: { issue_type, component, previous_attempts_count }
   ```

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - They often contain the exact solution
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - Does it happen every time?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes
   - Environmental differences

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**

   **WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):**

   **BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:**
   ```
   For EACH component boundary:
     - Log what data enters component
     - Log what data exits component
     - Verify environment/config propagation
     - Check state at each layer

   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component
   THEN investigate that specific component
   ```

   **Example (multi-layer system):**
   ```bash
   # Layer 1: Workflow
   echo "=== Secrets available in workflow: ==="
   echo "IDENTITY: ${IDENTITY:+SET}${IDENTITY:-UNSET}"

   # Layer 2: Build script
   echo "=== Env vars in build script: ==="
   env | grep IDENTITY || echo "IDENTITY not in environment"

   # Layer 3: Signing script
   echo "=== Keychain state: ==="
   security list-keychains
   security find-identity -v

   # Layer 4: Actual signing
   codesign --sign "$IDENTITY" --verbose=4 "$APP"
   ```

   **This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets → workflow ✓, workflow → build ✗)

5. **Trace Data Flow**

   **WHEN error is deep in call stack:**

   See `root-cause-tracing.md` in this directory for the complete backward tracing technique.

   **Quick version:**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

**Log checkpoint:**
```
MCP_DOCKER_insert_data: {
  event_type: 'debug:phase1_complete',
  metadata: { evidence_gathered, initial_hypotheses }
}
```

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Find the pattern before fixing:**

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - Locate similar working code in same codebase
   - What works that's similar to what's broken?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY
   - Don't skim - read every line
   - Understand the pattern fully before applying

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - List every difference, however small
   - Don't assume "that can't matter"

4. **Understand Dependencies**
   - What other components does this need?
   - What settings, config, environment?
   - What assumptions does it make?

5. **Check Memory for Patterns**
   ```
   MCP_DOCKER_search_memories: {
     query: "pattern {component} {symptom}"
   }
   ```

**Log checkpoint:**
```
MCP_DOCKER_insert_data: {
  event_type: 'debug:phase2_complete',
  metadata: { patterns_identified, differences_found }
}
```

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Scientific method:**

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Write it down
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

4. **When You Don't Know**
   - Say "I don't understand X"
   - Don't pretend to know
   - Ask for help
   - Research more

5. **Check Memory for Similar Hypotheses**
   ```
   MCP_DOCKER_search_memories: {
     query: "hypothesis {component}"
   }
   ```

**Log checkpoint:**
```
MCP_DOCKER_insert_data: {
  event_type: 'debug:phase3_complete',
  metadata: { hypothesis, test_result, confirmed_or_rejected }
}
```

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**

1. **Create Failing Test Case**
   - Simplest possible reproduction
   - Automated test if possible
   - One-off test script if no framework
   - MUST have before fixing
   - Use the `superpowers:test-driven-development` skill for writing proper failing tests

2. **Implement Single Fix**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements
   - No bundled refactoring

3. **Verify Fix**
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?
   - Issue actually resolved?

4. **Log Fix**
   ```
   MCP_DOCKER_insert_data: {
     event_type: 'debug:fix_implemented',
     metadata: { 
       root_cause: "...",
       fix: "...",
       files_modified: [...],
       test_verified: true/false
     }
   }
   ```

5. **If Fix Doesn't Work**
   - STOP
   - Count: How many fixes have you tried?
   - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information
   - **If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture (step 5 below)**
   - DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion

### Phase 5: Persistence (NEW)

**After successful fix:**

1. **Create Insight**
   ```
   MCP_DOCKER_create_entities: {
     entities: [{
       name: "Root Cause: {brief}",
       entityType: "RootCause",
       observations: [
         "Problem: {...}",
         "Root Cause: {...}",
         "Fix: {...}",
         "Prevention: {...}"
       ]
     }]
   }
   ```

2. **Link to Session**
   ```
   MCP_DOCKER_create_relations: {
     relations: [{
       from: "Root Cause: {...}",
       to: "Event: {...}",
       relationType: "DERIVED_FROM"
     }]
   }
   ```

3. **Log Session Complete**
   ```
   MCP_DOCKER_insert_data: {
     event_type: 'debug:session_complete',
     status: 'completed',
     metadata: { 
       duration_minutes,
       phases_completed,
       root_cause_found,
       insight_created
     }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4.5: Architecture Questioning

**If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture**

**Pattern indicating architectural problem:**
- Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling/problem in different place
- Fixes require "massive refactoring" to implement
- Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

**STOP and question fundamentals:**
- Is this pattern fundamentally sound?
- Are we "sticking with it through sheer inertia"?
- Should we refactor architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms?

**Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes**

This is NOT a failed hypothesis - this is a wrong architecture.

## MCP Tool Mapping for Debugging

| Debugging Task | MCP Tool | Table/Entity |
|----------------|----------|--------------|
| Query previous sessions | `MCP_DOCKER_query_database` | `events` table |
| Search for patterns | `MCP_DOCKER_search_memories` | Neo4j |
| Log session start | `MCP_DOCKER_insert_data` | `events` |
| Log phase complete | `MCP_DOCKER_insert_data` | `events` |
| Log root cause found | `MCP_DOCKER_insert_data` | `events` |
| Create insight | `MCP_DOCKER_create_entities` | Neo4j `RootCause` |
| Link to events | `MCP_DOCKER_create_relations` | Neo4j relations |
| Verify persistence | `MCP_DOCKER_query_database` | Verify by event ID |

## Event Type Naming Convention

- `debug:session_start` - Beginning of debugging session
- `debug:phase{N}_complete` - Phase N completed
- `debug:hypothesis_formed` - New hypothesis created
- `debug:hypothesis_tested` - Hypothesis tested
- `debug:root_cause_found` - Root cause identified
- `debug:fix_implemented` - Fix applied
- `debug:session_complete` - Session finished
- `debug:architecture_questioned` - 3+ fixes failed

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently"
- "Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- **"One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)**
- **"Each fix reveals new problem in different place"**

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture (see Phase 4.5)

## Your Human Partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong

**Watch for these redirections:**
- "Is that not happening?" - You assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" - You should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" - You're proposing fixes without understanding
- "Ultrathink this" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms
- "We're stuck?" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working

**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. |
| "I don't need to check memory" | Previous debugging knowledge saves time. Always hydrate. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **0. Hydration** | Query memory, summarize context | Know previous attempts and root causes |
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |
| **5. Persistence** | Log events, create insight | Knowledge preserved |

## When Process Reveals "No Root Cause"

If systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:

1. You've completed the process
2. Document what you investigated
3. Log findings to memory system
4. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)
5. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation

**But:** 95% of "no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation.

## Supporting Techniques

These techniques are part of systematic debugging and available in this directory:

- **`root-cause-tracing.md`** - Trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger
- **`defense-in-depth.md`** - Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause
- **`condition-based-waiting.md`** - Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling

**Related skills:**
- **superpowers:test-driven-development** - For creating failing test case (Phase 4, Step 1)
- **superpowers:verification-before-completion** - Verify fix worked before claiming success
- **roninmemory:memory-client** - For querying and logging to memory system

## Real-World Impact

From debugging sessions:
- Systematic approach: 15-30 minutes to fix
- Random fixes approach: 2-3 hours of thrashing
- First-time fix rate: 95% vs 40%
- New bugs introduced: Near zero vs common

**With memory integration:**
- Similar issues: 5 minutes (context already available)
- Pattern recognition: Automatic from previous sessions
- Knowledge sharing: Persistent across agents
